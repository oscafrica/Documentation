# Community Code of Conduct

> \_“Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much”

Open Source Community Africa community is made up of members from around Africa, with a diverse set of skills, personalities, and experiences. It is through these differences that our community experiences great successes and continued growth. When you're working with members of the community, this Code of Conduct will help steer your interactions and keep Open Source Community Africa a positive, successful, and growing community.

## Our Community

Members of Open Source Community Africa are **open, considerate, and respectful**. Behaviours that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

### Being open

Members of the community are open to collaboration, whether it's on PEPs, patches, problems, or otherwise. Focusing on what is best for the community. We're respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.

### Acknowledging time and effort

We're respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the OSCA community. We're thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that often times the labor was completed simply for the good of the community.

### Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

We're receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.

### Showing empathy towards other community members

We're attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we're tactful when approaching differing views.

### Being considerate

Members of the community are considerate of their peers -- other OSCA members.

### Being respectful

We're respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts.

### Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.

### Using welcoming and inclusive language

We're accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.
