# Chapter Leads OnBoarding Guide

[Open Source Community Africa](https://oscafrica.org/community) (OSCA) is an inclusive community for open-source lovers, enthusiasts, advocates, and experts within Africa. As a community, we intend to help integrate the act of open source contribution to African developers whilst strongly advocating the movement of free and open-source software.

Our goal is to increase the rate of credible contributions by African software developers, designers, writers, and everyone involved in the sphere of technology to open source projects both locally and globally, changing Africans' perception from just the billion users to the **NEXT BILLION CREATORS**.

### Recommended Practices

Successful leads ensure that the local community they lead embodies OSCA‚Äôs core mission and goals. We strongly recommend doing the following as a Chapter Lead:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Promote Open Source Community Africa and Open Source in your City.

* Evangelize the OSCA program within your local tech community.

* Act as a mentor to the community, connecting people and identifying partnerships.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Lead an engaged Discord communication Channel for your chapter.

* Promote ongoing discussion and knowledge sharing.
* Post content and resources about open-source frequently.
* Understand your community members‚Äô interests and create activities around them.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Host events and activities.

* Plan a physical or virtual event **at least once in three (3) months** to avoid being blacklisted.
* Invite local or global technical/non-technical speakers with experience in the covered topics.
* Communicate and partner with local communities, tech hubs, and influencers.
* Host any activity (meetup, webinar, workshop, hackathon, project, etc.) that supports your community's open-source education needs.

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Coordinate with OSCA‚Äôs community managers.

* Participate in the monthly community calls with your community manager.
* If you need to take any action and you're unsure if it's acceptable, please ensure to run the idea through your community manager for approval before proceeding.
* Coordinate with the Open Source Community Africa for support in planning your event (swag, promotion, etc.).
* Submit event reports after every meetup/event you organize for your local community.

### Social Media

As an OSCA lead, you represent us and our values, and we implore you **not** to use any hate speech on social media. Instead, find below guides to follow while interacting with members of your community:

1. Create a [Gmail address](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp) for your chapter (e.g., oscakampala@gmail.com). You will use this email to sign up for other approved services and to send emails to members of your community/event attendees.
2. Create a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup) for your chapter and customize the account.
3. Ensure that the account name always starts with OSCA followed by the chapter name (e.g., OSCA Nairobi), and the handle should be OSCA (in lowercase) followed by the chapter name (e.g., @oscanairobi or @osca\_nairobi).
4. Upon creating a social account for your chapter, kindly copy, edit and use this for your chapter‚Äôs bio: _"A budding @oscafrica community of open-source advocates and contributors in \[Chapter‚Äôs city, State, Country Flag]."_
5. Always tag @oscafrica when creating awareness about your events or initiatives.
6. Use the hashtags like **#OSCAUyo**. That is, #OSCA\[City of your chapter].
7. When giving out information, ensure that it is from a reliable source.
8. Do not post negative information about OSCA or its affiliates or partners.

### Chapter Leads Hub

As an OSCA Chapter Lead, you will use the private [Chapter Leads Hub](https://github.com/oscafrica/chapter-leads-hub) for:

* Discussing and planning chapter activities.
* Requesting help, support, or materials from Open Source Community Africa.
* Tracking and talking about the activities you are organizing.
* Exploring the design assets, expenses guide, and sponsorship guide.
* Anything else a Chapter Lead needs to be successful.

### Finance and Sponsorships

At Open Source Community Africa, we are transparent and manage all processes of expenses and sponsorships via our [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/osca). You are not allowed to create anything new for your financing. All you need to do is keep records of your expenses and submit them accordingly where required. Suppose you need to receive sponsorship from external entities; you can receive them in your personal bank account (keep receipts and report to your community manager about this) or contact your community manager for details around receiving through the Collective.

You will learn more about submitting expenses in the private Chapter Leads Hub.

Thank you for coming this far. We wish you all the best as you begin this new journey. Cheers! üß°\\
