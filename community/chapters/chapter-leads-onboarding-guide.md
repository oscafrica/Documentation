# Chapter Leads OnBoarding Guide

[Open Source Community Africa](https://oscafrica.org/community) (OSCA) is an inclusive community created in 2018 for open-source lovers, enthusiasts, advocates, and experts within Africa. As a community, we intend to help integrate the act of open-source contribution to African developers whilst strongly advocating the movement of free and open-source software.

Our goal is to increase the rate of credible contributions by African software developers, designers, writers, and everyone involved in the sphere of technology to open-source projects both locally and globally, changing Africans' perception from just the billion users to the **NEXT BILLION CREATORS**.

As an OSCA Chapter Lead, you represent a global network of open-source enthusiasts, and you are responsible for growing and supporting a vibrant local OSCA community in Africa.

### Social Media

As an OSCA lead, you represent us and our values, and we implore you **not** to use any hate speech on social media. Instead, find below guides to follow while interacting with members of your community:

1. Create a [Gmail address](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp) for your chapter (e.g., oscakampala@gmail.com). You will use this email to sign up for other approved services and to send emails to members of your community/event attendees.
2. Create an [X (Twitter) account](https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup) for your chapter and customize the account.
3. Ensure that the account name always starts with OSCA followed by the chapter name (e.g., OSCA Nairobi), and the handle should be OSCA (in lowercase) followed by the chapter name (e.g., @oscanairobi or @osca\_nairobi).
4. Upon creating a social account for your chapter, kindly copy, edit, and use this for your chapter‚Äôs bio: _"A budding @osca\_hq community of open-source advocates and contributors in \[Chapter‚Äôs city, State, Country Flag]."_
5. Always tag @oscafrica when creating awareness about your events or initiatives.
6. Use the hashtags like **#OSCAUyo**. That is, #OSCA\[City of your chapter].
7. When giving out information, ensure that it is from a reliable source.
8. Do not post negative information about OSCA or its affiliates or partners.
